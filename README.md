- 🎨 Aspiring Graphic Designer | 🌟 Passionate about Visual Storytelling | 💻 Proficient in Adobe Creative Suite | 🌐 Exploring the Intersection of Design and Technology | 📚 Currently studying Graphic Design at @ArteveldeHS

👋 Hi there! I'm Azize ER, a student pursuing a degree in Graphic Design with a focus on creating visually compelling narratives. I'm deeply passionate about the power of design to communicate ideas and evoke emotions.

🖌️ My journey in graphic design began with a love for doodling and sketching, which evolved into a fascination with digital art and typography. I'm proficient in Adobe Creative Suite, including Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, and I love experimenting with new tools and techniques to push the boundaries of my creativity.

🌈 My design style is characterized by a blend of bold colors, clean lines, and attention to detail. I believe in the importance of storytelling in design, whether it's through branding, illustration, or user experience.

🚀 Outside of design, you can find me exploring the latest trends in technology or simply immersing myself in a good book or podcast.

Let's connect and collaborate on exciting design projects! Feel free to reach out to me via email : azize.er2002@gmail.com!
